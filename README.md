# Prediction-of-CO2-emitted-by-cars
In this project, we will use a linear regression model to predict the CO2 emissions of cars based on their weight and volume. The dataset used for this task contains information about various cars, including their weight, volume, and corresponding CO2 emissions. this is done in jupyter notebook and using machine learning model
